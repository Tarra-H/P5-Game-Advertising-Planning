# Game Advertising Planning

You work at the online store Ice, which sells video games from around the world. Data related to user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game can be considered successful. This way, you can find the most promising games and plan their advertising campaigns.

You have data from 2016. Imagine it is now December 2016, and you are planning campaigns for 2017.

This dataset includes the abbreviation ESRB. ESRB stands for Entertainment Software Rating Board, an independent regulatory organization that evaluates game content and assigns age ratings such as Teen or Mature.
